The Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients, but you don't have to calculate them in order to create the triangle because each row can be constructed using the previous one
Each row contains an increases in size and contains numbers which can be derived by adding adjacent members of the previous row.

 the  (x+1)^i where i is the row

 so i= 4
(x+1)^4 = 1x^4 + 4x^3+6x^2+4x+1
row 4 would have 1, 4, 6, 4, 1
